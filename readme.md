## Overview
Our project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for facial emotion detection in images. We have also developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to ensure ease of use and seamless navigation.

## Environment set up

**To use our facial emotion detection system, please follow the instructions below:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.


## Usage
* For Facial emotion detection GUI, run main.py.
* For Human object detection, run Human_object_detection.py.
* For data analysis, run Proportion.py in data_analysis folder.

Note: When selecting an image for the emotion detection process, it is important to ensure that the image has been preprocessed to include only the head region.
